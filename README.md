"# Football-Player-ImageClassifier" 
<br>
Project goal: to build a simple image classification application which does follow:
- Using python [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) as a web scrapping tool to pull image from google image and form a dataset.
- Using [openCV](https://opencv.org/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) as well as image augmentation technique to train classification models.
- Using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) to create a web server and launch the model in the previous stage as a web application.
